## Description
Dive into the elusive world of AI Agents and learn how to build them! There are so many frameworks, models, and practices to build them and the entire field is just getting started. In this workshop, we'll be building an agent to scrape and standardize data through a natural language interface.

## Installation

This project uses [Rye](https://rye-up.com/) for dependency management. Follow these steps to set up the project:

1. Install Rye if you haven't already:
   ```
   curl -sSf https://rye-up.com/get | bash
   ```

2. Clone the repository:
   ```
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/fantastic-agents-and-how-to-build-them.git
   cd fantastic-agents-and-how-to-build-them
   ```

3. Install dependencies using Rye:
   ```
   rye sync
   ```

This will create a virtual environment and install all the required dependencies specified in the `pyproject.toml` file.

4. Activate the virtual environment:
   ```
   . .venv/bin/activate
   ```

Now you're ready to start working on the project!


## Example Solutions

If you find yourself stuck or running short on time, you can refer to the finished versions of the examples:

1. Simple AI Agent: [simple_example_finished.py](src/fantastic_agents_and_how_to_build_them/simple_example_finished.py)
2. Complex AI Agent: [data_analysis_agent_finished.py](src/fantastic_agents_and_how_to_build_them/data_analysis_agent_finished.py)

These files contain the complete implementations of the agents we'll be building during the workshop. While it's recommended to work through the exercises on your own, these resources are available if you need additional guidance or want to compare your solution.


## Learning Outcomes
